Structure of project:

  Important note's:

  - In /assets/complex/ Use chip1.blend to make 3d object edit and export to
  .gltf format. This file is not in active part of application.
  /assets/complex/chip1.gltf is file loaded intro web app.
  Also used gltf loader for /assets/decorations/ ...
  and \assets\wheel-roll\center\centerRoll.gltf
  CenterRoll downloaded from http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/72520
  and taken only one part.
  In readme.md you have licence just leave it to make legal use.

- assets/fonts/helvetiker_regular.typeface.json comes from three.js see docs.
  It is a 3d text shema not classic web font for regular DOM.
- /scripts/bet-map/bet-map.js is handler for beting system.
  Most important is betMapCurrentBets.getWinningValue(winNumber) You need first to know
  winning number than use it.
- Chips image used in app is located at:
  - tag 128 indicate size 128x128.
  \assets\complex\chips-128\chip1.png
  Other chips images in folder table is only src with better size.

- You need to follow function `setWinningNumber` from roulette-table.js to make sence
  about flow in this project. It is a interest moment.

  application.js is main startup file.
  Use object `app` to save some parameters if you need it.

  In folder /scripts/libs/ most important file is `cannon.engine.js`.
  Please see cannon.js docs for more information.

It is a clear javascript custom methodology in most simpliest way.
I use procedural aspect started from application.js. In all scripts i
use simple function call for example :
  - removeNoWinChips()
  - removeAllPhisicsChips()
  - removeAllChips()
It is very descriptively with one basic programming role `single responsibility`.


[Not in use] Actually not in use but can be implemented if you have different idea.
